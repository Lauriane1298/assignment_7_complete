  To stop food waste, changes have to be brought in at every stage of the process – from farmers and food processors to supermarkets and individual customers. As a first step, priority should be given to balancing production with demand. This essentially translates to lesser use of natural resources to produce food which is not needed. There are also plenty of actions we can take at the consumer level to make a significant difference. From delivering leftovers to those in need of freezing food, shopping smarter, and composting to keep scraps out of landfills, we can all take small steps to curb our emissions. To stop food waste, changes have to be brought in at every stage of the process – from farmers and food processors to supermarkets and individual customers. As a first step, priority should be given to balancing production with demand. This essentially translates to lesser use of natural resources to produce food which is not needed. We can learn many lessons from our great-grandparents’ generation, including how to make “no waste” cool again. Given that we have seen huge improvements in technology, preservation, and supply chain management since those days, it’s certainly possible for us to do even better. Considering the urgency of reducing our carbon emissions, we must do better. However, the pace of progress can be slow. In the meantime, it is an injustice to allow people to go hungry and for perfectly good food to be thrown into a landfill. We must address the dual problems of hunger and food waste on all fronts and believe that a solution to both challenges can be found when we work together.
