<div class="food">
    In order to help the food waste cause and make a global impact, the three easiest steps we recommend taking are to reduce (use less of — or do without — unnecessary ingredients and cook smaller portions to avoid excessive leftovers), reuse (repurpose food scraps instead of throwing them out and use reusable containers to buy foods in bulk), and recycle (compost leftover food scraps). Continue reading for specific steps you can take as a producer and/or a consumer.

    What can producers do?

<div class="producerstext"> 
    Food manufacturers play a major role in reversing the food waste trend. This can be done both through influencing supplier and end consumer behaviors, as well as through direct and tangible action.
(1) Packaging plays an important role in protecting and preserving food throughout the supply chain and in the home. However, simply reducing packaging is not always preferable because as packaging is reduced and/or compromised, the likelihood of food spoilage arising increases. 
(2) Food manufacturers can be vocal about the problem of food waste and provide practical tips for customers looking to reduce their individual impact. This includes controlling portions, learning to properly preserve leftovers and other practical suggestions.
(3) Many manufacturers unnecessarily waste raw ingredients because of inaccurate forecasting. With better and more accurate forecasting models, food manufacturers can spend less time guessing and more time maximizing the ingredients they have.

<div class="consumers"> 
    What can consumers do?
</div>

<div class="consumerstext"> 
    Developing habits to save more of the food we already have will put less strain on the resources associated with producing and buying food and aid in reducing the creation of greenhouse gas emissions. (1) Move older food products to the front of the fridge/cupboard/freezer and just-purchased ones to the back. This makes it more likely foods will be consumed before they go bad. (2) Keep your refrigerator at 40 degrees F or below to prolong the life of foods. Foods frozen at 0 degrees F or lower will remain safe indefinitely but the quality. (3) Freeze or can surplus fresh produce using safe, up-to-date food preservation methods. (4) Compost food scraps for use in the garden. (5) Check product dates on foods. (6) Buy misshapen fruits and vegetables at farmers' markets and elsewhere. They taste just as good and are just as nutritious as those with a "perfect" shape but are more likely to get thrown away.
